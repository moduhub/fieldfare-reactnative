# Fieldfare React Native

This is the React Native version of the [Fieldfare from ModuHub](https://github.com/moduhub/fieldfare).

## What is the Fieldfare framework?

Fieldfare is a backend framework, created to solve the problem of data ownership. This is achieved using Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) and re-creating the basic data structures (Lists, Sets and Maps) to use DHTs as their engine. Thus, data can be stored anywhere, and since the Hash Tables use a cryptographic secure hashing algorithm (SHA), the data source does not need to be verified.

Instead of a central authority, as in a classic system, Fieldfare uses the concept of "environments". An environment is a consensus network where all its members can perform changes and verify each other's changes in a blockchain fashion. This is done using a Distributed Version Control scheme similar to GitHub to solve synchronization problems, actions can be performed simultaneously, and potentially concurrently, by all the hosts in the environment.
